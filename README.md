# smart-tablet
Project in stand-by (until I know how to use Tkinter perfectly)

This is the code for a "smart tablet" I wanted to implement in real life (tablet which could control lights of my house, see temperature, pressure, humidity etc) and also displayed a live map of the weather (clouds, rain, temperature).

Warning : Please be careful at the sight of this code (better safe than sorry)
